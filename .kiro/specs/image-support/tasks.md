- [ ] 5. Implement image-to-note connections

  - Extend ConnectionItem to support ImageItem as connection endpoints
  - Add connection creation from images to notes with drag-and-drop interaction
  - Implement connection point distribution around image perimeter to avoid visual clutter
  - Add connection line updates when connected images are moved or resized
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_

- [ ] 6. Implement note-to-image connections

  - Add connection creation from notes to images using existing connection patterns
  - Implement bidirectional connection support between notes and images
  - Add visual styling for image connections with appropriate arrow indicators
  - Ensure connection deletion works properly for image connections
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [ ] 7. Add image context menu and operations

  - Create context menu for images with rotation options (90°, 180°, 270°, custom)
  - Add opacity adjustment controls with real-time preview
  - Implement image deletion with confirmation dialog
  - Add image property access and reset-to-original-size functionality
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5_

- [ ] 8. Integrate images with session management

  - Extend SessionManager to serialize/deserialize image data as base64 encoded strings
  - Add image data structure to session file format with metadata preservation
  - Implement image restoration from session files with proper error handling
  - Add image data validation and corruption detection during load operations
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5_

- [ ] 9. Add image canvas integration features

  - Integrate images with existing zoom and pan functionality
  - Add images to fullscreen mode support with proper scaling
  - Implement image selection and multi-selection support
  - Add images to canvas statistics and bounds calculation
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5_

- [ ] 10. Implement consistent interaction patterns

  - Ensure image interactions match note interaction patterns for consistency
  - Add hover effects and cursor changes for images similar to notes
  - Implement image selection highlighting and visual feedback
  - Add keyboard shortcuts and accessibility support for image operations
  - _Requirements: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5_

- [ ] 11. Create comprehensive image tests

  - Write unit tests for ImageItem class covering all image operations
  - Add integration tests for drag-and-drop workflow and file handling
  - Create tests for image-connection interactions and serialization
