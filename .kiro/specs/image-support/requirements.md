# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Image Support feature extends the Digital Whiteboard application to allow users to drag and drop images onto the canvas, creating visual elements that can be manipulated, resized, and connected to notes just like other whiteboard elements. This feature enhances the whiteboard's capability to support visual thinking by incorporating external images, diagrams, screenshots, and other visual content into the creative workspace.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to drag and drop image files from my file system onto the whiteboard canvas, so that I can incorporate visual content into my brainstorming and note-taking sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user drags an image file from their file system over the canvas THEN the system SHALL display a visual indicator showing the drop is accepted
2. WHEN a user drops an image file onto the canvas THEN the system SHALL create a new image item at the drop location
3. WHEN an image is dropped THEN the system SHALL support common image formats (PNG, JPEG, GIF, BMP, SVG)
4. IF an unsupported file type is dropped THEN the system SHALL display an error message and reject the drop operation
5. WHEN an image is successfully added THEN the system SHALL maintain the original aspect ratio by default

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to resize images on the canvas by dragging resize handles, so that I can adjust the visual prominence and fit of images within my whiteboard layout.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects an image THEN the system SHALL display resize handles at the corners and edges of the image
2. WHEN a user drags a corner resize handle THEN the system SHALL resize the image while maintaining aspect ratio
3. WHEN a user drags an edge resize handle THEN the system SHALL resize the image in that dimension only
4. WHEN a user holds a modifier key while resizing THEN the system SHALL allow free-form resizing without aspect ratio constraints
5. WHEN resizing is complete THEN the system SHALL save the new image dimensions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to move images around the canvas by dragging them, so that I can position visual content exactly where I need it in relation to my notes and other elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks and drags an image THEN the system SHALL move the image to follow the cursor position in real-time
2. WHEN an image is being moved THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback showing the current position
3. WHEN a user releases the image THEN the system SHALL save the new position permanently
4. WHEN an image is moved THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing connections to and from the image
5. IF an image overlaps with other elements during movement THEN the system SHALL handle layering appropriately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create connections from notes to images, so that I can visually link my written ideas to relevant visual content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user drags from a note to an image THEN the system SHALL create a visual connection line between the note and image
2. WHEN a connection is established THEN the system SHALL display the connection with appropriate visual styling (arrow, line)
3. WHEN a connected note or image is moved THEN the system SHALL automatically update the connection line to maintain the visual link
4. WHEN a user wants to delete a note-to-image connection THEN the system SHALL provide a method to remove the connection without affecting the elements
5. WHEN multiple connections exist to an image THEN the system SHALL distribute connection points around the image perimeter

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create connections from images to notes, so that I can use visual content as a starting point for written explanations or ideas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user drags from an image to a note THEN the system SHALL create a visual connection line between the image and note
2. WHEN a connection is established THEN the system SHALL display the connection with directional indicators showing the flow from image to note
3. WHEN a connected image or note is moved THEN the system SHALL automatically update the connection line to maintain the visual relationship
4. WHEN a user wants to delete an image-to-note connection THEN the system SHALL provide a method to remove the connection independently
5. WHEN an image has multiple outgoing connections THEN the system SHALL manage connection point distribution to avoid visual clutter

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want images to integrate seamlessly with the existing whiteboard functionality, so that visual content behaves consistently with other whiteboard elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are present on the canvas THEN the system SHALL include them in save and load operations
2. WHEN the canvas is zoomed THEN the system SHALL scale images appropriately while maintaining visual quality
3. WHEN the canvas is in fullscreen mode THEN the system SHALL display images with full functionality
4. WHEN images are selected THEN the system SHALL provide context menu options for common operations (delete, copy, properties)
5. WHEN images are part of the whiteboard session THEN the system SHALL preserve image data and positioning across application restarts

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to perform basic image operations like rotation and opacity adjustment, so that I can customize how visual content appears in my whiteboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user right-clicks on an image THEN the system SHALL provide options for rotation (90°, 180°, 270°, custom)
2. WHEN an image is rotated THEN the system SHALL update all connected lines to maintain proper connection points
3. WHEN a user accesses image properties THEN the system SHALL provide an opacity slider for transparency adjustment
4. WHEN opacity is changed THEN the system SHALL apply the change immediately with visual feedback
5. WHEN image transformations are applied THEN the system SHALL save these properties with the whiteboard session

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want images to support connection creation through the same interaction patterns as notes, so that the interface remains intuitive and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates connection creation from an image THEN the system SHALL use the same drag-and-drop mechanism as note connections
2. WHEN hovering over potential connection targets while dragging THEN the system SHALL provide the same visual feedback as note connections
3. WHEN a connection is being created THEN the system SHALL show a preview line from the image to the cursor position
4. WHEN a valid connection target is reached THEN the system SHALL highlight the target element to indicate connection possibility
5. WHEN connection creation is cancelled THEN the system SHALL return to normal state without creating any connections
