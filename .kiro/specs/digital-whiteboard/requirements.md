# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Digital Whiteboard is a desktop application built with PyQt6 and Python that provides users with a freeform canvas for creating, connecting, and organizing notes in a non-linear manner. The application enables creative thinking by removing traditional document constraints and allowing users to visualize relationships between ideas through flexible connections and spatial arrangements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create notes anywhere on the canvas by double-clicking, so that I can capture ideas without being constrained by predetermined layouts or structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user double-clicks on any empty area of the canvas THEN the system SHALL create a new editable note at that exact location
2. WHEN a note is created THEN the system SHALL automatically focus the note for immediate text input
3. WHEN a user clicks outside an active note THEN the system SHALL save the note content and exit edit mode
4. IF the canvas area is occupied by an existing element THEN the system SHALL still allow note creation in available space

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to connect notes using drag-and-drop functionality, so that I can visualize relationships and connections between different ideas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user drags from one note to another THEN the system SHALL create a visual connection line between the notes
2. WHEN a connection is established THEN the system SHALL display arrows or lines that clearly indicate the relationship direction
3. WHEN a user moves a connected note THEN the system SHALL automatically update the connection lines to maintain visual links
4. WHEN a user wants to delete a connection THEN the system SHALL provide a method to remove individual connections without affecting the notes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to move and arrange notes freely on the canvas, so that I can reorganize my ideas and create meaningful spatial relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user drags a note THEN the system SHALL move the note to the new position in real-time
2. WHEN notes are moved THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing connections and update connection lines accordingly
3. WHEN a user releases a note THEN the system SHALL save the new position permanently
4. IF notes overlap during movement THEN the system SHALL handle layering appropriately without losing content

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize the appearance of notes including text, colors, and styles, so that I can create visual distinctions between different types of ideas or categories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a note THEN the system SHALL provide options to change text color, background color, and font style
2. WHEN appearance changes are made THEN the system SHALL apply them immediately and save the preferences
3. WHEN a user creates new notes THEN the system SHALL allow setting default styling options
4. IF custom styles are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain visual consistency across all connected elements

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to group related notes using background shapes or visual containers, so that I can organize ideas into logical categories while maintaining the freeform nature of the canvas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects multiple notes THEN the system SHALL provide an option to create a background grouping shape
2. WHEN a background shape is created THEN the system SHALL visually contain the selected notes without restricting their individual movement
3. WHEN notes are moved within a group THEN the system SHALL maintain the group association
4. WHEN a user wants to modify groups THEN the system SHALL allow adding, removing, or dissolving group associations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to enter full-screen mode, so that I can work in a distraction-free environment focused entirely on my brainstorming session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user activates full-screen mode THEN the system SHALL hide window decorations and maximize the canvas area to fill the entire screen
2. WHEN in full-screen mode THEN the system SHALL provide a clear method to exit back to normal view
3. WHEN entering or exiting full-screen mode THEN the system SHALL preserve all canvas content and user work
4. IF full-screen mode cannot be activated THEN the system SHALL provide an alternative maximized window view option

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the canvas to support infinite scrolling and zooming, so that I can work with large idea maps without space limitations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user scrolls beyond the current canvas boundaries THEN the system SHALL extend the available workspace seamlessly
2. WHEN a user zooms in or out THEN the system SHALL maintain note readability and connection visibility at all zoom levels
3. WHEN the canvas is very large THEN the system SHALL provide navigation aids to help users orient themselves
4. IF performance becomes an issue with large canvases THEN the system SHALL implement efficient rendering to maintain responsiveness

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save and load my whiteboard sessions, so that I can continue working on my ideas across multiple sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes changes to the whiteboard THEN the system SHALL automatically save the current state
2. WHEN a user returns to the application THEN the system SHALL restore the previous session state including all notes, connections, and layout
3. WHEN saving occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve note content, positions, styling, connections, and groupings
4. IF the save operation fails THEN the system SHALL notify the user and provide retry options
